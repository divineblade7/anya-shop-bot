# Anya Shop Bot 

[Leia este documento em portuguÃªs.](README.pt-br.md)

The purpose of this project is to share the knowledge I gained during 
development of this bot. I hope to inspire others to embark on this journey 
and discover that programming is accessible to anyone who is willing to learn
and seek information.

The motivation for this project was to fulfill my dream of developing a bot,
something I have desired since my first contact with bots and programming 22 
years ago. Recently, I completed a full-stack developer course, and even though
I didn't acquire the knowledge specifically for this, I decided to try to 
achieve what I once thought was impossible and I succeeded =)

## Installation and Prerequisites

Before using the bot, it is necessary to ensure that some tools are installed 
on your system:

### 1) Python
The Anya Shop Bot is developed in Python, which is necessary for running the 
program, so you will need to install it on your machine.
- [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [Python for Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
- [Python for macOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)

### 2) Tesseract
This is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) that allows the bot to convert 
images into text. It is essential for the bot to function correctly.
